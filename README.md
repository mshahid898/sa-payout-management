- Wallet configuration
- Payment history generation
- Timeline step generation

## Production Deployment

The application is configured for production deployment with:
- Optimized Vite build configuration
- Element Plus component library
- Responsive design
- Error handling and validation

### Vercel Deployment

This project is configured for deployment on Vercel:

1. **Configuration Files:**
   - `vercel.json` - Vercel deployment settings with SPA routing
   - `vite.config.js` - Production build optimizations with code splitting
   - `.nvmrc` - Node.js version specification (Node 18)

2. **Build Configuration:**
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Output directory: `dist`
   - Framework: Vite
   - SPA routing: All routes redirect to `index.html` for client-side routing

3. **Build Optimizations:**
   - Code splitting: Vendor libraries (Vue, Vue Router, Element Plus) are split into separate chunks
   - Minification: Uses esbuild for fast production builds
   - Asset optimization: Assets are organized in the `dist/assets/` directory

4. **Deployment Steps:**
   ```bash
   # Build locally to test
   npm run build
   
   # Preview production build
   npm run preview
   
   # Push to GitHub (Vercel auto-deploys on push)
   git push origin main
   ```

### Environment Requirements

- **Node.js**: 18.x (specified in `.nvmrc`)
- **Package Manager**: npm (v10+ recommended)
- **Build Tool**: Vite 4.x

### Build Output

The production build generates:
- `dist/index.html` - Main HTML file
- `dist/assets/` - Compiled JavaScript and CSS files
  - `vue-vendor-*.js` - Vue core libraries
  - `element-plus-*.js` - Element Plus UI library
  - `index-*.js` - Application code
  - `index-*.css` - Styles

### Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
1. Check Node.js version matches `.nvmrc` (Node 18)
2. Verify `package.json` is in the repository root
3. Ensure all dependencies are listed in `package.json`
4. Check Vercel build logs for specific errors
